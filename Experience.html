		<h1>Experience</h1>

		<h2>Phenom People</h2>
		<p>This past summer, I had the amazing opportunity of being a remote Talent Marketing Intern for a company called <a href="https://www.phenom.com/">Phenom People</a>. Phenom is a global HR technology company with the purpopse of helping 1 billion people find the right job. They utilize and provide an AI-based SaaS platform that connects all interactions across the four key talent experiences: Candidate Experience, Employee Experience, Recruiter Experience, and Management Experience.</p>

		<p>Throughout my internship, I worked under a super welcoming, passionate, and inspirational HR team. Although all of the work I did was virtual, I was still able to grow and develop professional skills that I will take with me through college and beyond. Here are some of my achievements and skills I developed:
		•	Built email campaigns from start to finish: wrote the body copy, created graphics, and advised on day and time for campaign launch to increase open rate. I also analyzed campaign analytics and performance of these emails.
		•	Published remote internship blog post to global career site
		•	Researched and contacted local Philadelphia college career centers to establish partnerships for recruitment purposes
		•	Collaborated with interns from a variety of departments to create video content for the company's social media and the career site
		•	Assisted the talent marketing lead with day-to-day recruitment marketing responsibilities, including response management strategy and content creation for a platform called Comparably 
		•	Contributed to the research and strategy of employment brand on social media, including Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter</p>

		<h2>TA Bodyshop</h2>

		<p>Over the past few years at home, I have worked part-time as a Customer Service and Reception Employee at TA Bodyshop, a local fitness studio that specializes in group boxing and HIIT fitness classes, as well as personal training, to people of all fitness levels. Throughout my experience at TA Bodyshop, I was able to gain marketing skills as I helped to promote the startup on social media. I also received and billed clients for exercise classes and personal training. It was super enjoyable for me to work for and promote a brand that specializes in one of my passions.</p>
