		<h1>Academics</h1>

<p>I attended my town's public school, Tenafly High School.</p>

<p>Succeeding high school, I chose to attend UW-Madison not only because of the beautiful and scenic campus and city, but because of the prestigious education offered, school spirit, passionate student body and endless opportunities.</p>

<p>During high school, I wasn't too sure what field I wanted to pursue. I took a bunch of different elective classes before realizing that business was the career path I wanted to follow into college and beyond. I began my freshman year of college at UW-Madison on the Pre-Business track, and was accepted into the <a href="<a href="https://www.wisc.edu/>Wisconsin School of Business</a> this past summer.</p>

	<h1>Major and Certificates</h1>

	<h2>Marketing</h2>

	<p>I have always had a keen interest in marketing, and upon acceptance to the Wisconsin School of Business, I declared Marketing as my major. The Marketing major curriculum will provide me with knowledge about the foundations of marketing, and how they affect business strategy and implementation. I will have the opportunity to develop skills such as critical thinking, quantitative and qualitative analysis, creativity, problem solving, and more, which will ultimately prepare me for a future career. I believe that the most compelling factor for this major is its flexibility to pursue several areas of interest. For someone like me, who isn't sure exactly what job she wants to pursue, this is a critical factor.</p>

	<h2>Spanish Studies for Business Students</h2>
	<img src="images\spanish.jpg" alt="My Photo" width="500" height="300">
	<p>I began to learn Spanish as a young girl at te age of 3, and have since wanted to perfect my skills and learn about the language, culture, and country as a whole. Thus, I have decided to pursue a certificate in <a href="https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/spanish-portuguese/spanish-studies-business-students-certificate/"> Spanish Studies for Business Students</a> that will not only allow me to develop communication skills in Spanish, but will also provide me with specialized vocabulary associated with business, the knowledge to understand and incorporate these concepts into my speech and writing, and finally an understanding of Hispanic cultures and their characteristics.</p>

	<h2>Digital Studies</h2>
	<img src="images\digital studies.png" alt="My Photo" width="500" height="300">
	<p>I chose to declare a second certificate in <a href="https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/communication-arts/digital-studies-certificate/">Digital Studies</a> because I believe that the skills and knowledge I will obtain will help me stand out immensely when applying for a job, especially if I pursue a career in digital marekting. Thie certificate answers important questions about the relationship between comunication and digital forms of media, and will edcuate me on important concepts including digital information structures, digital media, digital forms, and digital practices.</p>
