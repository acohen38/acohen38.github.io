		<h2>Food</h2>
		<p>I would consider myself a very adventurous eater. I love to try new foods, but I also have my staples: foods that I know I will love wherever I go. I have gone to quite a few different restaurants in the past few years, and I take pictures of almost everything that is ordered, even if it isn't mine. Below are some of my eats from this summer up until now! Enjoy and don't get too hungry!</p>

		<h2>Fitness</h2>
		<p>I have been an athlete for as long as I can remember, so fitness has always been a passion of mine. In the beginning of high school, I began to train in the off-season, when I wasn't playing a sport everyday. My mother has been a true inspiration of mine when it comes to fitness, and she pushes me to work hard each and every day, even from thousands of miles away. My favorite types of exercise are running, lifting and strength training, and boxing. I strive to get some sort of exercise in at least 5-6 times a week.</p>

		<p>In Madison, I utilize the Nicholas Recreaction Center for most of my strength training and treadmill workouts. The new building has tons of equipment and machines that have really helped me continue with my passion for exercise.</p>

		<p>	During quarantine, I wasn't able to go to the gym, so my family decided to purcase a Peloton treadmill and membership. The membership comes with an abundance of different types of fitness classes, from strength training to even dance cardio, and the treadmill offers all types of treadmill-style workouts. At home, I use the treadmill almost every day, and I never seem to get bored because of the many types of classes offered.</p>

   		 <p>Above is a video of a quick boxing session after a HIIT class with my trainer. I began to box a few years ago, and while I am certainly not an expert, it is something that I love to do!</p>
