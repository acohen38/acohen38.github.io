		<h2>Friends and Family</h2>
		<p>When I'm not doing school work or exercising, I can usually be found with my friends or family. I love to be around people and surround myself with people who make me feel my best. For that reason, I enjoy spending time with my many friends at school, and my friends and family at home. Sharing moments and creating memories with others is something that I deeply cherish, and I am so thankful to have such supportive, fun, and genuine people in my life.</p>

		<p>My dog is definitely the favorite in the family. His name is Maui, and he is a 9-year-old Vizsla. He is super playful, fun and friendly. Below are some photos of him!</p>

		<h2>Cooking</h2>
		<p>My grandmother is a food stylist, and she inspired my passion for cooking and baking at a young age. Cooking and baking are two activties that I truly feel passionate about and love to do. Cooking/baking in the kitchen is just such a soothing, satisfying activity for me, it allows me to delve into my creative side, and teaches me that its okay to fail sometimes. I live an in apartment with three roommates in Madison, and I have been doing my best to cook as many meals as possible. While I definitely have more time to spend in the kitchen at home in New Jersey, I do my best to whip up some creative, delicious meals here in Madison. Here are a few photos of my recent meals!</p>

		<p>This was a meal that I cooked with Chef Josh Capon, a family friend of mine. He is an amazing cook and content creator, and the work he does is truly inspiring to me. This meal was a ribeye steak, cooked medium-rare, with grilled onions and Mexican street corn.</p>
